## WriteTech Hub Bootcamp 4.0

Hi, there. I'm **Iraadat**, pronounced `ee-raw-dah`.

A once upon a time Finance professional finding her feet in the tech world.

I currently provide support for businesses that use _M365_. I am proficient in troubleshootng technologies like Outook, Teams, Exchange Online, SharePoint and OneDrive.

Today, I will talk about a Bootcamp I am in where I am learning technical writing. It has been a n insightful discovery. Everything was going great until I had to learn Git - it's been o=such a ride.
I always run a away from code or anything like it but I think it is the life now. 

It is nt getting any easier - at least for now.

I look forward to coming back to this not-so-article to say I conqured and not he other way around.

> Fighting!
